# to_do_list
Source code for the simple to do list app! Create a new expo project and experiment with the code to learn how react works! Here's how to import it into your project. First create a project in your command prompt by `expo init [project name]`. Then `cd [project name]` and `npm start`. 

Once your have your project running, just copy the contents from the App.js file and paste it into your app.js file. We recommend using VS Code as your IDE!
